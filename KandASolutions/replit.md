## Deployment Strategy

### Static Hosting

## Technical Decisions

### Why Static Website?
- **Problem**: Need professional online presence quickly
- **Solution**: Static website with modern styling and interactions
- **Benefits**: Fast loading, easy deployment, low maintenance
- **Trade-offs**: Limited dynamic functionality, no server-side processing

### Why Vanilla JavaScript?
- **Problem**: Need interactive features without complexity
- **Solution**: Pure JavaScript for form handling and navigation
- **Benefits**: No framework overhead, better performance, easier maintenance
- **Trade-offs**: More manual DOM manipulation, less structured code organization

### Why External CDNs?
- **Problem**: Need professional fonts and icons
- **Solution**: Google Fonts and Font Awesome via CDN
- **Benefits**: Faster loading, automatic updates, reduced bundle size
- **Trade-offs**: External dependencies, potential loading delays
